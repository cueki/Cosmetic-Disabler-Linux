## What does this program do?
The Cosmetic Disabler allows you to disable cosmetics of your choice, stopping them from rendering in-game, while leaving every other cosmetic unaffected.

It will ***dynamically update*** with Team Fortress 2 and should not need to be updated after updates to detect new cosmetics.
## How do I use it?
Download the latest release and run 'Cosmetic Disabler.exe' to start the program. On first time start-up you will have to provide your 'Team Fortress 2' directory.
Once the directory is selected the program will load every cosmetic in TF2 into a list.



You can double-click on a cosmetic to disable/re-enable it. When you are ready to create a VPK with your changes, click the 'Create VPK' button to generate the VPK file. You will be given a choice on behavior regarding cosmetic bodygroups, and then the file will be created in the same folder as the program.
