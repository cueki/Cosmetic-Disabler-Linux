This folder contains files that are used for replacing cosmetic models. These files are only used if the cosmetic disables one of the designated bodygroups.

The naming format for the files are [CLASS]_[BODYGROUP]

If you have other mods or need/want to replace them for some reason, you are free to try. Replacing these files is completely untested and you do at your own risk.
